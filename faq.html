                                            <p>Ref CF Offerings are high risk opportunities and may not retain their value. Investing in startups and small businesses is inherently risky and standard company risk factors such as execution and strategy risk are often magnified at the early stages of a company. In the event that a company goes out of business, your ownership interest could lose all value. Furthermore, private investments in startup companies are illiquid instruments that typically take up to five and seven years (if ever) before an exit via acquisition, IPO, etc.</p>

                                            <p>Companies conducting a Reg CF are privately held companies, and their shares are not traded on a public stock exchange. As a result, the shares cannot be easily traded or sold. As an investor in a private company, you typically receive a return on your investment under the following two scenarios: The company gets acquired by another company. The company goes public (makes an initial public offering on the NASDAQ, NYSE, or another exchange). In those instances, you receive your pro-rata share of the distributions that occur, in the case of acquisition, or you can sell your shares on the exchange. It can take 5-7 years (or longer) to see a distribution or trading, as it takes years to build companies. In many cases, there will not be any return as a result of business failure. Dalmore Group, LLC does not make investment recommendations, and no communication, through this website or in any other medium should be construed as a recommendation for any security offered on or off this investment platform. Investments in private placements and start-up investments in particular are speculative and involve a high degree of risk, and those investors who cannot afford to lose their entire investment should not invest in start-ups. Companies seeking startup investments tend to be in earlier stages of development, and their business model, products and services may not yet be fully developed, operational or tested in the public marketplace. There is no guarantee that the stated valuation and other terms are accurate or in agreement with the market or industry valuations. Additionally, investors on Regulation CF offerings will receive securities that are subject to holding period requirements. In the most sensible investment strategy for start-up investing, start-ups should only be part of your overall investment portfolio. Further, the start-up portion of your portfolio may include a balanced portfolio of different start-ups. Investments in startups are highly illiquid and those investors who cannot hold an investment for the long term (at least 5-7 years) should not invest.</p>

                                                Business due diligence Dalmore Group, LLC conducts research and due diligence on each company before it is able to accept investments on the platform.  Dalmore Group, LLC will typically conduct over 30-40 hours of due diligence per opportunity, which requires the satisfactory completion of a detailed set of individual questions and data requests.  Particular focus is paid to the following issues throughout the due diligence process:  Problem or inefficiency being addressed Product / service overview, stage of development and anticipated milestones Demonstrated traction (e.g. revenue, pre-sales, purchase orders, signed contracts, media coverage, awards, etc.) Data to support claims made in marketing materials (e.g. user / customer metrics, signed contracts and agreements, product demonstrations, etc.) Growth strategy Employees and advisors (including ownership structure) Addressable market (e.g. size, growth, penetration, etc.) Competitive landscape and industry dynamics Exit opportunities Intellectual property Historical financials Financial projections(including error-checking, evaluation of key assumptions and reconciliation to stated growth plan) Reference checks (e.g. previous investors, advisors, etc.) Investment overview (including determination of key terms, uses of funds, and current and previous investors) The findings of the foregoing review are presented to Dalmore Group, LLC, which may approve, reject, or require additional information for the offering. Upon approval and following the onboarding process, an offering can begin accepting investments online. General considerations Notwithstanding the foregoing, these investments are illiquid, risky and speculative and you may lose your entire investment.  The foregoing summarizes our standard process. However, each diligence review is tailored to the nature of the company, so the aforementioned process is not the same for every issuer. Completing the vetting process does NOT guarantee that the company has no outstanding issues or that problems will not arise in the future.  While the foregoing process is designed to identify material issues, there is no guarantee that there will not be errors, omissions, or oversights in the due diligence process or in the work of third-party vendors utilized by Dalmore Group, LLC. Each investor must conduct their own independent review of documentation and perform their own independent due diligence and should ask for any further information required to make an investment decision.
