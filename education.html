                            <p><strong>Form C:</strong> Prior to launching a Section 4(a)(6) equity crowdfunding
                                campaign, the issuer must
                                complete and submit a Form C to the SEC together with required attachments. Companies
                                that
                                file a Form C are required to disclose certain information to the public, which can be
                                used to
                                understand the investment, which helps determine whether a particular investment is
                                appropriate for a specific person. This includes general information about the issuer,
                                its officers
                                and directors, a description of the business, the planned use for the money raised from
                                the
                                offering, often called the use of proceeds, the target offering amount, the deadline for
                                the
                                offering, related-party transactions, risks specific to the issuer or its business, and
                                financial
                                information about the issuer.</p>
                            <p><strong>Material Changes:</strong> If the issuer makes a material change to the offering
                                terms (e.g., the total
                                amount of the offering, the type of security, etc.) or other information disclosed to
                                investors,
                                including if the deadline is extended, each investor will be given five business days to
                                reconfirm
                                their investment commitment. If the investor does not reconfirm, their investment will
                                be
                                canceled, and their funds will be returned. In addition, if the issuer makes a material
                                change, an
                                amendment must be filed with the SEC.</p>
                            <p><strong>Annual Filing Obligation of Issuers:</strong> Each issuer that successfully
                                completes a Title III
                                Regulation Crowdfunding securities offering is required to annually file with the SEC a
                                Form CAR and financial statements. This must be done no later than 120 days after the
                                end of the
                                Issuer's fiscal year covered by such filing. Each Issuer must also post its Form C-AR
                                and
                                financial statements to its own website, and that link must be provided along with the
                                date by
                                which such report will be available on the issuer's website. The Form C-AR contains
                                updated
                                disclosure substantially similar to that provided in the issuer's initial Form C,
                                including
                                information on the issuer's size, location, principals and employees, business, plan of
                                operations, and the risks of investment in the Issuer's securities; however,
                                offering-specific
                                disclosure is not required to be disclosed in the Form C-AR. Investors should be aware
                                that an
                                issuer may no longer be required to continue its annual reporting obligations under
                                certain
                                circumstances. In the event that an issuer ceases to make annual filings, investors may
                                no
                                longer have current financial information about the Issuer available to them. An issuer
                                must
                                continue to comply with the ongoing reporting requirements until one of the following
                                occurs:

                            <p><strong>Audit:</strong> An audit provides a higher level of scrutiny by the accountant than a review. The required
                                information is filed with the SEC and posted at the start of the offering on the Dalmore Group,
                                LLC and available to the public throughout the offering on the Dalmore Group, LLC, and SEC
                                sites. It is available to the general public on both websites throughout the offering period –
                                which must be a minimum of 21 days.</p>
                            <p><strong>Reviewed Financials:</strong> A review of an organization's financial statements provides a report
                                issued by a CPA that expresses that the financial statements are free from material
                                misstatement. A review provides limited assurance on an organization's financial statements.
                                During a review, inquiries and analytical procedures present a reasonable basis for expressing
                                limited assurance that no material modifications to the financial statements are necessary; they
                                conform with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
                            <p><strong>GAAP Financials:</strong> All companies raising funds under Regulation CF must provide financial
                                statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). For
                                companies incorporated over 120 days ago, GAAP financials must include a cover page, balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows, statement of stockholder's equity,
                                and footnotes (typically 2 -5 pages including accounting methodologies used, an explanation of
                                your taxes, a summary of any debt, and a summary of outstanding equity). </p>
                            <p><strong>Investment Limitations:</strong> Because of the risks involved with this type of investing, you are limited
                                in how much you can invest during any 12-month period in these transactions. The limitation on
                                how much you can invest depends on your net worth and annual income. If either your annual
                                income or your net worth is less than $124,000, then during any 12-month period, you can invest
                                up to the greater of either $2,500 or 5% of the lesser of your annual income or net worth.</p>
                                <p>If both your annual income and your net worth are equal to or more than $124,000, then during
                                    any 12-month period, you can invest up to 10% of annual income or net worth, whichever is less,
                                    but not to exceed $124,000 or all crowdfunding offerings in any 12 month period. The following

                        <p> <strong>Calculating Net Worth:</strong> each investor in a Reg CF must calculate their net worth. All assets are
                            totaled, and all liabilities are subtracted from that total. For crowdfunding, the investor's primary
                            residence value is not included in the net worth calculation. The SEC's Investor Bulletin
                            Crowdfunding for Investors contains detailed and valuable information about how to perform
                            these calculations.

                        <p> <strong>Changing Your Mind:</strong> Each investor has up to 48 hours prior to a rolling close, or 48 hours prior
                            to the offering deadline, to change their mind and cancel the investment commitment for any
                            reason. However, once the offering period is within 48 hours of ending, the investment may not
                            be cancelled for any reason, even if the commitment is made during this period. Following the
                            close on funds, the investor will receive securities in exchange for their investment. If the
                            investment commitment is not cancelled 48 hours prior to the offering deadline or a rolling
                            close, the funds will be released to the company by the escrow agent. If the investment
                            commitment is cancelled before the 48-hour deadline, Dalmore Group, LLC will direct the return
                            of any funds that have been committed.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cancellation of Investment Commitment by Issuer:</strong> The issuer may cancel the investment
                            commitment under the following circumstances:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For any offering that has not yet been completed or terminated, an issuer may file on
                                    Form C/A an amendment to its offering statement to disclose changes, additions, or
                                    updates to information. An amendment is required for changes, additions, or updates
                                    that are material, and in those required instances the issuer must reconfirm outstanding
                                    investment commitments within 5 business days, or the investor’s commitment will be
                                    considered canceled. If the RedCrow Platform was required to cancel the investment
                                    commitment, it must then send a notice of the cancelation to the investor and direct
                                    refusal of the investor’s funds.</li>
                                <li>Offering fails to reach the target by the specified deadline. If an issuer does not raise the
                                    target funds by the deadline it established, the Company has five days to provide
                                    investors with notice of the cancelation of the investment commitment, direct the refund
                                    of investor funds, and prevent investors from committing any additional funds to the
                                    offering.</li>
                                <li>The issuer may cancel the offering for another reason including if the issuer experiences
                                    sudden financial difficulties, the discovery of fraud, the sudden departure of a key
                                    person, or for any other reason in which the offering is not in the best interest of the
                                    issuer.</li>

                            <p> <strong>Common Stock:</strong> Conveys a portion of the ownership interest in the company to the holder of the
                                security. Stockholders are usually entitled to receive dividends when and if declared, vote on
                                corporate matters, and receive information about the company, including financial statements.
                                This is the riskiest type of equity security since common stock is last in line to be paid if a
                                company fails. You should read our discussion of the risks of early stage investing and pay
                                special attention to the fact that your investment will only make money if the company's
                                business succeeds. Common Stock is a long-term investment.

                                <strong>Preferred Stock:</strong> Stock that has priority over common stock as to dividend payments and the
distribution of the company's assets. Preferred stock can have the characteristics of either
common stock or debt securities. While preferred stock gets paid ahead of common stock, it
will still only be repaid on liquidation if there is money left over
after the company's debts are paid. In certain circumstances (such as an initial public offering
or a corporate takeover) the preferred stock might be convertible into common stock (the
riskiest class of equity). You should review the terms of the preferred stock to know when that
might happen.

                               <strong>Convertible Note:</strong>  This form of investment is popular because it allows investors to initially lend
money to the company and later receive shares if new professional investors decide to invest.
The sort of convertible note that is most often offered on the Dalmore Group, LLC platform may
limit the circumstances in which any part of the loan is repaid, and the note may only convert
when specified events (such as a preferred stock offering of a specific amount) happens in the
future. You will not know how much your investment is "worth" until that time, which may never
happen. You should treat this sort of convertible note as having the same risks as common
stock.

                                <strong>SAFE:</strong> Simple Agreement for Future Equity. The SAFE investor has the right to obtain equity
when the company sells shares in a future financing, using a cheap and simple contract. SAFEs
solve the complex, time-consuming, and expensive problem of valuing an early-stage startup
and documenting a priced equity investment. A SAFE is not a loan, does not have a legal
obligation to be repaid, does not accrue interest, and does not have a maturity date.

                               <strong> Side by Side: </strong>A Side-by-Side offering refers to a deal that is raising capital under two offering
types. For instance, a Side-by-Side offering may involve a raise under Regulation CF and Rule
506(c) of Regulation D.
                            </p>
                            <p> <strong>Valuation Caps:</strong> The valuation caps reward early convertible note or SAFE investors. It sets the
                                maximum price that your convertible security will convert into equity. To translate that into a
                                share price, you divide the valuation cap by the series A valuation. Based on the valuation cap
                                investors will be entitled to equity priced at the lower of the valuation cap or the pre-money
                                valuation in the subsequent transaction.</p>
                            <p><strong>Debt/Revenue Share:</strong> Securities in which the seller must repay the investor's original investment
                                amount at maturity plus interest. Debt securities are essentially loans to the company, and the
                                significant risk they bear is that the company does not repay them, in which case they are likely
                                to become worthless.</p>
                            <p><strong>Post-Money Valuation:</strong>  The valuation of the company after a new investment. Calculated by
                                adding the pre-money valuation and the amount of the new investment.
                                </p>
                            <p><strong>Pre-Money Valuation:</strong> The valuation of the company prior to a new investment. This does not
                                include the amount of the new investment. The marketplace (supply and demand) determines
                                the pre-money valuation of a private company.</p>
                                <p><strong>Valuation:</strong> What the company is considered to be worth by the marketplace. Based on the
                                    valuation, percentage ownership can be calculated. By itself, the price per share of the stock
                                    does not provide any meaningful information.</p>

                                    consider the risks of investing in crowdfunded securities offerings and determine whether such

                                <p>This means the decision to invest must be based solely on your own individualized
                                    consideration and analysis of the risks involved in a particular investment opportunity posted on

                                    with such decisions, which include the risk of losing the entire amount of their principal.

                                    <strong>Investment in small, especially start-up and early stage, companies is speculative and
involves a high degree of risk.</strong> While targeted returns on the amount invested should
reflect the perceived level of risk in the investment, such returns may never be realized
and/or may not be adequate to compensate an Investor for risks taken. <strong>Loss of an
Investor’s entire investment is very possible and can easily occur.</strong> Even the timing of
any payment of a return on an investment is highly speculative.

                                    Unlike listed companies that are valued publicly through market-driven stock prices, the
<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/11/valuing-startup-ventures.asp" target="_blank">valuation</a> of startups can be difficult to determine and is often subjective. You may risk
overpaying for the equity stake you receive

                                    There may be additional classes of equity or derivatives with rights that are superior to
the class of equity being sold through crowdfunding. Additionally, investments are
<strong>subject to <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/11/dangers-of-stock-dilution.asp" target="_blank">dilution</a>,</strong> which is when early investors see a reduction in ownership
percentage as new stock is issued.

                                    <strong>A regulation crowdfunding investment may actually need to be held for an indefinite
period of time.</strong> Unlike investing in companies listed on a stock exchange where you can
quickly and easily trade securities on a market, you may have to locate an interested
buyer privately when you seek to resell your crowdfunded investment even after the oneyear restriction expires as there is not an established market for these shares. There is
no assurance these securities will ever be publicly tradable.
                                </li>

                                    An early-stage company <strong> may be able to provide only limited information</strong> about their
business plan and operations because they do not have fully developed operations or a
long history to provide more disclosure.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Publicly listed companies generally are required to disclose information about their
performance at least on a quarterly and annual basis and on a more frequent basis
about material events that affect the Issuer. In contrast, crowdfunding companies are
only required to disclose their results of operations and financial statements annually.
Therefore <strong>you may have only limited continuing disclosure about your crowdfunding
investment.</strong>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Investment opportunities posted on the portal, the adequacy of the disclosures, or the
fairness of the terms of any such investment opportunity have not been reviewed or
approved by a state or federal agency.

                                <li>
                                    The Issuer in all likelihood will not have an internal control infrastructure and there
<strong>cannot be any assurance of no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the
quality of the Issuer’s financial and disclosure controls and procedures. </strong>Indeed, if it
were necessary to implement such financial and disclosure controls and procedures, the
cost to the Issuer might even have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s operations.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    A portion of your investment may fund the compensation of the Issuer’s employees,
including its founders and management. Due to inexperience, management may not be able to execute on its business plan. Additionally, unless the Issuer has agreed to a
specific use of the proceeds from the offering, the Issuer’s management will usually
have considerable discretion over how to use the capital raised. <strong>You may not have any
assurance the Issuer will use the proceeds appropriately.</strong> You should pay close
attention to what the Issuer says about how offering proceeds are to be used.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Because the Issuer’s founders, directors and executive officers may be among its
largest stockholders, they may be able to exert significant control or influence over the
Issuer’s business and affairs and <strong>may even have actual or potential interests that
diverge from those of other Investors.</strong> This may worsen as time goes on if the holdings
of the Issuer’s directors and executive officers increase upon vesting or other
maturation of exercise rights under options or warrants they may hold, or in the future be
granted. In addition to holding or controlling board seats and offices, these persons may
well have significant influence over and control of corporate actions requiring
shareholder approval, separate from how the Issuer’s other stockholders, including
Investors, may vote in a given offering.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>The issuing company may have serious risks specific to its industry or its business
model.</strong> Demand for a product or service may be seasonal or be impacted by the overall
economy. Small businesses, in particular, often depend heavily upon a single customer,
supplier, or upon one or a small number of employee(s). It may have difficulty competing
against larger companies who can negotiate for better prices from suppliers, produce
goods and services on a large scale more economically, or take advantage of bigger
marketing budgets.
                                </li>

                                    In light of the relative ease with which early-stage companies can raise funds through
crowdfunding, it may be the case that certain opportunities turn out to be money-losing
fraudulent schemes. As with other investments, <strong>there is no guarantee that
crowdfunding investments will be immune from fraud.</strong> Even with the portal’s careful
investigation of companies and their executive teams, there is a risk of fraudulent
activity
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Many successful companies partially attribute their early success to the guidance of
professional early-stage investors (e.g., angel investors and venture capital firms). These
investors often negotiate for seats on the Issuer’s board of directors and play an
important role through their resources, contacts and experience in assisting early-stage
companies in executing on their business plans. <strong>An early-stage company primarily
financed through crowdfunding may not have the benefit of such professional
investors.</strong>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The Issuer may not provide you with annual audited financial statements or quarterly
unaudited financial statements, except as required by a particular registration
exemption. <strong>The Issuer may not even have its financial statements audited, or even
reviewed by outside auditors.</strong> Your decision to make an investment in the Issuer will be
based upon the information the Issuer provides in its offering materials, which may not
completely or even accurately represent the financial condition of the Issuer.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    As explained above, <strong>an Investor may not be able to obtain the information it wants
regarding a particular Issuer on a timely basis, or at all.</strong> It is possible that the investor
may not be aware of material adverse changes that have occurred to the Issuer. An Investor may not be able to get accurate information about an Issuer’s current value at
any given time.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Federal securities law requires securities sold in the United States to be registered with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), unless the sale qualifies for an
exemption. The securities offered on RedCrow Securities have not been registered under
the Securities Act, and are offered in reliance on an exemptive provisions of the
Securities Act. Securities sold on the portal are likely restricted and not publicly traded
and are therefore illiquid. No assurance can be given that any investment opportunity
will continue to qualify under one or more of such exemptive provisions of the Securities
Act due to, among other things, the adequacy of disclosure and the manner of
distribution, the existence of similar offerings in the past or in the future, or a change of
any securities law or regulation that has retroactive effect.

                            <p>The risks highlighted above are non-exhaustive. Investors must carefully review each Issuer's
                                offering materials for a more complete set of risk factors specific to the investment. You should
                                only invest an amount of money you can afford to lose without impacting your lifestyle.

                                <p>The required type of financial disclosure depends on how much an Issuer has already raised,
                                    and how much they intend to raise next.
                                    </p>
                            <p><strong> $124,000 or less:</strong> If the current offer plus previous raises amounts to $124,000 or less, the
                                Issuer provides information from its tax returns (but not the tax returns themselves) certified by
                                the principal executive officer. If financial statements are available they must be provided, too,
                                and again certified by the principal executive officer.</p>
                            <p><strong>$124,000.01 to $618,000:</strong> If the current offering plus previous raises is between $100,000 and
                                $618,000, financial statements are required and must be reviewed by a CPA. If audited financial
                                statements are available, they must be provided.
                                </p>
                            <p><strong>$618,000.01 to $1.235 million:</strong> If current offer plus previous raises amounts to $618,000.01 or
                                more, the required financial statements must be audited by a CPA. However, if the Issuer has
                                not previously sold securities under Regulation Crowdfunding, the financial statements will only
                                be required to be reviewed by a CPA.</p>

                                securities-related activity is conducted by Dalmore Group, LLC (“Dalmore Group”).
                                Dalmore Group does not make investment recommendations and no communication, through
                                this website or in any other medium should be construed as a recommendation for any
                                security offered on or off this investment platform. Equity crowdfunding investments in
                                private placements, and start-up investments in particular, are speculative and involve
                                a high degree of risk and those investors who cannot afford to lose their entire
                                investment should not invest in start-ups. Companies seeking startup investments through
                                equity crowdfunding tend to be in earlier stages of development and their business
                                model, products and service may not yet be fully developed, operational or tested in the
                                public marketplace. There is no guarantee that the stated valuation and other terms are
                                accurate or in agreement with the market or industry valuations. Additionally, investors
                                may receive illiquid and/or restricted stock that may be subject to holding period
                                requirements and/or liquidity concerns. In the most sensible investment strategy for
                                start-up investing, start-ups should only be part of your overall investment portfolio.
                                Further, the start-up portion of your portfolio may include a balanced portfolio of
                                different start-ups. Investments in startups are highly illiquid and those investors who
                                cannot hold an investment for the long term (at least 5-7 years) should not invest.
                                Dalmore Group does not provide custody services in connection any investments made
                                through the platform.

                                price can be received until the offering statement is filed with the SEC and only
